                The term “greenwashing” has become ubiquitous within the sustainability movement, as companies have increasingly tried to convince the public that they are improving sustainability measures, whether they are or not. The same can be said for other consumer interests such as social justice. This makes sense, as consumers more than ever care about the ethics and sustainability behind the products they purchase. Accordingly, companies have unsurprisingly taken up ESG measures and updated marketing strategies to put these measures in the best light for consumers. But all this begs the question of how well companies are actually doing on these measures. Looking at the data reveals that the picture is a lot more complex than you might expect.

                We can begin by using the Fashion Transparency Index (FTI), which is a metric that was created by a non-profit to track the ESG performance of top companies over the past few years. Using their environmental axes, and overall scores, we can see how well companies have performed at improving their environmental performance.

                Looking at the sustainability axis of FTI, it’s evident that fashion brands are gradually enhancing their environmental performance, although the progress is slow. We can see that sustainability improves more than the overall FTI score (which also includes governance and social justice). This positive trend towards eco-friendliness is mirrored in recent media and journalism, where there is increasing coverage of companies' green initiatives. Major players in this sector have been making significant strides in reducing their carbon emissions and phasing out environmentally harmful materials. For decades consumers have been demanding more sustainability from these brands, and the growing corporate consciousness is in large part an adaptation to these demands.

                Another important topic on the top of consumers’ minds has been the ethics of production. The collapse of Rana Plaza was a turning point for fashion companies’ ethical practices, as it caused the world to look at the wholistic process behind their clothing. As a result, brands really wanted to improve how they look in the face of controversies about labor practices. But have things improved? We can look at what outsourcing practices look like today to get an idea- the Global Slavery Index rates countries on how likely labor practices are to result in modern slavery or human rights abuses. When looking at where companies are getting their clothes, the picture isn’t very uplifting.

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
                Clearly, outsourcing is not something of the past, countries in the global north disproportionately take advantage of global south countries, where the risk of modern slavery is rampant, with labor laws being lax and poorly enforced. These countries have become hotbeds for unethical labor practices, as companies in wealthier nations seek to minimize costs without consideration for the human cost involved. 

                It’s important to note that you can see that countries have also improved at their risk of modern slavery and worker abuse. The risk map in 2023 is significantly better than the one from 2016. This change can be attributed to a combination of factors, including increased international awareness, stronger regulations, and a growing commitment from corporations to uphold ethical standards in their supply chains. Governments and NGOs have also played a pivotal role in this transformation, implementing policies and initiatives aimed at protecting vulnerable workers and holding companies accountable for their labor practices. Research from Fashion Revolution found “In 2023, we saw an increase in brands engaging with government and industry stakeholders to advocate for better labor policies. This included brands like H&M and Levi Strauss & Co. participating in the G7 Fashion Pact, which aims to promote sustainable and ethical fashion practices globally. Additionally, brands like Patagonia and The North Face have been vocal advocates for stronger labor protections in specific countries, such as Bangladesh and Vietnam” 

                Seeing how progress on these two axes has been different begs the question of how related progress in these two measures is related. For conscious consumers, a company should be both ethical and sustainable- but are all sustainable companies, ethical and vice versa? Or do companies’ efforts in one coincide with efforts in another?

One way to quantify this is with Beaker scores. Beaker scores companies on their ethical and environmental performance, and creates a composite score representing their average. It calculates individual scores utilizing publicly available data on brands, and using this data to note what practices a brand has. Practices correspond either positively or negatively to a brand’s scores. We can look at Beaker’s environmental and ethical scores on a plot to see the correlation between these two:

                Notably, there is a distinct correlation between ethical scores and environmental scores, but environmental scores don’t increase as slowly as ethical scores. This comes down to the companies bottom lines. Implementing environmental changes, such as reducing carbon emissions or minimizing waste, often involves upfront investments in technology or infrastructure. However, these investments can lead to long-term cost savings, such as reduced energy consumption or lower waste disposal fees. Many environmental initiatives are supported by government incentives, grants, or tax breaks, making them financially feasible or even advantageous in the long run.

                On the other hand, making ethical changes, particularly in areas like labor rights and fair wages, can be more financially challenging. Ensuring ethical labor practices often means higher operational costs, as it involves paying fair wages, investing in safer working conditions, and ensuring compliance with labor regulations. These costs are recurrent and can significantly impact a company's bottom line, especially in the fashion industry, which is reliant on skilled labor. And until more recently, there have been fewer direct financial incentives from governments for companies to invest in these areas, making the decision to prioritize ethical practices a more costly one.

                Although brands' actions have shown improvement over time, it’s important to note that brands are often exaggerating their improvements. The data shows that improvements have been modest over time, both in the sustainability and justice axes. Environmental initiatives have seen somewhat more rapid advancement, likely due to the dual benefits of long-term cost savings and regulatory incentives. Ethical practices, particularly concerning labor rights and fair wages, have evolved more slowly, hampered by higher ongoing operational costs and a lack of direct financial support.

                This disparity highlights a critical need in the fashion industry: a balanced approach that equally prioritizes both environmental sustainability and ethical labor practices. It's clear that one cannot be deemed a substitute for the other. Consumers and stakeholders must continue to hold brands accountable, demanding transparency and genuine action rather than mere rhetoric. As we face the ongoing and worsening impacts of the climate crisis, it will be crucial for fashion companies to integrate both these aspects into their core business strategies, moving beyond superficial greenwashing and genuinely committing to holistic and sustainable practices. Only then can the fashion industry hope to fully align with the evolving values of its consumer base and make a meaningful impact on both the environment and the lives of those within its supply chain.
